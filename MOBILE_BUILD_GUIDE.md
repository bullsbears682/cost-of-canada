# Your APK will be in:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 📲 **Install Your APK on Phone:**

### **Method 1: Direct Install**
```bash
# Install the APK you just built
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Or if adb not available, copy APK to storage

# Then install from file manager
```

### **Method 2: Share APK**
```bash
# Copy to shared storage
cp app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk ~/storage/shared/

# Download Android command line tools
cd ~
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip

# Extract and set up
unzip commandlinetools-linux-9477386_latest.zip
mkdir -p android-sdk/cmdline-tools
mv cmdline-tools android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest

# Set environment variables
export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

# Accept licenses and install platform
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
```

### **Build Signed APK (Play Store Ready):**
```bash
# Generate keystore (one time only)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Configure signing in android/app/build.gradle
# Then build release APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
